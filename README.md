# SimpleMultiPane
Demonstration of multipane

 I have created an app called simplemultipane which demonstrates the use of the concepts that we discussed yesterday.To summarize the concepts used in this app:-

    Designing for multiple screens-using qualifiers layout-land(landscape)
    Implementing Adaptive UI-  dual-pane
    Handling input gestures-

    Show the list pane when the content pane is swiped right.
    Hide the list pane when we touch the content(description) pane.
    Hide the list pane when we swipe the content pane left.


In the app I have used single activity and two different fragments(I have considered drawer layout kind of an example where one for the list menu and the other shows the content of the item selected)I have chosen 2 different flashy colours just for differentiation purpose.

As the user turn the phone to landscape mode or the user uses a tab then both the fragments are shown side by side.

As the user swipes to the right or left then accordingly those fragments are displayed.
